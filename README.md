# 1-Layer-Perceptron-Geometric-Shape-Recognition-No-ML-libs
This project implements a single-layer perceptron neural network without using any machine learning libraries. The model is trained from scratch to recognize geometric shapes (initially circles) from compressed black-and-white images. The entire implementation relies solely on NumPy for numerical operations and PIL for image processing.
